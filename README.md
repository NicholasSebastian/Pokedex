## Pokedex Web App

![alt text](screenshot.png)

Made for fun cause I was bored. I wanted it to look like the one in the animated series.<br>
Though functionality wise, it wasn't made to give a lot of information, it was only meant to look cool.<br>
The amount of CSS I had to write was horrendous.

### Purpose
Another random project I randomly felt like doing.<br>
Also, I wanted to practice using React's hooks and its context API, and since this project has multiple screens which in themselves are seperate individual components, it makes it perfect for trying out sharing states among multiple components.

### Attribution
This app was made using [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), a public REST API for pokemon information.<br>
Specifically, I used https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi-js-wrapper for its built-in caching.
