## Pokedex Web App

https://pokedexter.netlify.app/

![alt text](screenshot.png)

Made to simulate the look and feel of the Pokedex in the anime series.<br>
Though functionality wise, it wasn't made to give a lot of information, it was only meant to look cool.<br>
The amount of CSS I had to write was horrendous.

### Attribution
This app was made using [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), a public REST API for pokemon information.<br>
Specifically, I used https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi-js-wrapper for its built-in caching.
